How to run the web app:

I will assume familiarity with how to use github 
repositories, but if you are not familiar, the most
important commands are git clone, git commit, and git push
so you can look those up if you have any questions. 

Steps for running app:

1) Make sure you have node.js installed on your system 
(you can check this by typing node -v on the command line
and if not downloaded, see download instructions here: https://nodejs.org/en/)

2) In directory, run following two commands from command line:
    a) npm install
    b) npm install -g express-generator

3) navigate into the bin directory and type node www
After a couple of seconds you should see some message like:
GET / 304 844.713 ms - -
GET /stylesheets/style.css 304 27.260 ms - -

4) Open up browser and type http://localhost:3000/
